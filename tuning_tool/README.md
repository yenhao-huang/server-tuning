The performance tuning tool can automatically identify the I/O pattern of a server workload with the MLP model and tweak the system knobs of the operating system and storage controller based on the optimal configuration to improve the performance of the serverâ€™s workload.

This user-friendly tool requires only one click (one command) from the user to launch the optimization. The optimization takes about 6 minutes to come into force because the tool requires 5 minutes to profile the system. If the workload does not match any pre-defined I/O pattern, the tool will stop conducting any undesired optimization and inform the user.

## Usage

The tool accepts one parameter, `$appName`, the name of the application to be optimized.

```powershell
## In PowerShell
./run.ps1 [appName]
```

> **NOTE**: This tool requires administrator privileges to run because it profiles and tunes the system. Make sure to run it in an elevated PowerShell session.

## Execution

The tool sequentially runs:

1. Profiling script (`profiling.ps1`)

    This script profiles the specified application using Windows Performance Monitor (`logman`) for five minutes.

2. Reformat script (`reformat.ps1`)

    This script formats the profiling result by converting a binary log file (.blg) to a comma-separated values file (.csv) with the `relog` command and removing some useless content.

3. Inference executable (`MLP_inference.exe`)

    This executable takes the formatted profiling result as input and identifies the I/O pattern of the specified application. 

4. Setting knob script (`setting_knob.ps1`)

    This script adjusts the settings of the operating system (Windows Server) and the storage controller (HPE SR416i-a Gen10+) based on the predicted I/O pattern.

The tool exits with an exit value of `0` if everything went well. Otherwise, it exits with an exit value of `1` and outputs informative error message.

### Tool Configuration

The script provides several variables for users to configure the script based on their needs, including:
- `$script:dataDir`: The directory where the data is stored.
- `$script:profilingResult`: The file of profiling result.
- `$script:featureValue`: The file of feature extracted from profiling result.
- `$script:ssacli`: The path to the Smart Storage Administrator Command Line Interface.
- `$script:iopatternPrediction`: The file of predicted I/O pattern.
- `$script:controllerSlot`: The slot number of the controller.
- `$script:logicalDiskID`: The ID of the logical disk.
